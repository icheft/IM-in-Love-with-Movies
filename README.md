# GenEdu 5010 Final Project

Presented by IM in love with Movies

## Skill Sets

+ Data Collection
    + [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and 3rd Party Python Library [tmdbv3api](https://github.com/AnthonyBloomer/tmdbv3api)
    + Scraping from Rotten Tomatoes using BeautifulSoup to parse HTML documents with a little help from another [Python package](https://github.com/pdrm83/rotten_tomatoes_scraper) that is made to do this job
    + Outdated

        Originally, we try to scrape all the data from Taiwan Film & Audiovisual Institute to see if the data is useful for the analysis.

        The work is done using `wget` to download the Excel file and `BeautifulSoup` to locate the URL. 
+ Visualization
    + Plotly
    + Dash (an extension of Plotly)
    + matplotlib


## Milestones
